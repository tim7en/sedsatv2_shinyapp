<h2>Anomalies</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Decompose a series of observations into deviations (anomalies) from the mean
for selected periods and the remainder (HFV or high frequency variation)
using the method described in Appendix A of Vecchia (2000).
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre>
anomalies(x, ...)
</pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table summary="R argblock">
<tr valign="top"><td><code>x</code></td>
<td>
<p>a time series (ts) or a vector of observations that represents a
daily series. Missing values (NAs) are allowed only at the beginning and end
of the series.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>...</code></td>
<td>
<p>named anomalies and the length of the selected periods,
generally in days. The anomalies must be specified in order of decreasing
length.</p>
</td></tr>
</table>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The intent of computing anomalies is to give flexibility in fitting the
relation between flux, or concentration, and flow for time periods longer
than a couple of years. Taking a very simple regression model:<br />
</p>
<p><em>C = B0 + B1 * Q + e</em>,<br />
</p>
<p>where <em>C</em> is the concentration, <em>B0</em> and <em>B1</em> are the regression coefficients, <em>Q</em> is
the flow, and <em>e</em> is the error. This can be re-expressed in terms of flow
anomalies (for this example, 5- and 1-year anomalies are used, many others are possible):<br />
</p>
<p><em>C = B0 + B1 * Qbar + B1 * A5 + B1 * A1 + B1 * HFV + e</em>,<br />
</p>
<p>where <em>C</em>, <em>B0</em>, <em>B1</em>, and <em>e</em> are the same as the simple regression, and <em>Qbar</em> is the
mean flow, <em>A5</em> is the 5-year anomaly, <em>A1</em> is the 1-year anomaly, and <em>HFV</em> is the
high-frequency variation. The simple regression model assumes that the
regression coefficient (<em>B1</em>) is constant for all anomalies. Computing
anomalies removes that constraint and is represented by this model:<br />
</p>
<p><em>C = B0 + B1 * A5 + B2 * A1 + B3 * HFV + e</em>,<br />
</p>
<p>where <em>C</em>, <em>A5</em>, <em>A1</em>, <em>HFV</em>, and <em>e</em> are the same as the re-expressed model, and <em>B0</em>,
<em>B1</em>, <em>B2</em>, and <em>B3</em> are regression coefficients (numerically different from the
simple coefficients). <em>Qbar</em> is a constant and is not needed for the regression.<br />
</p>
<p>Anomalies are computed sequentially. First, the mean of <code>x</code> is computed and
subtracted from the data. Then for each anomaly, the running mean of the
specified period is computed (the anomaly) and is subtracted from the data.
The remainder is the HFV. This procedure ensures that the sum of the
anomalies plus the mean is equal to the original data.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A matrix of the specified anomalies and HFV. The mean of <code>x</code> is
included as an attribute.
</p>


<h3>Note</h3>

<p>The output matrix contains missing values in the beginning,
corresponding to the length of the longest anomaly.<br />
</p>
<p>A long time-frame anomaly that is often of interest, is the 5-year
anomaly, which is 1,826 days.
